## Nodes :sweat_drops:

I utilize cloud providers such as Hetzner, Netcup GmbH and DigitalOcean for my Nodes & projects, meticulously choosing them based on location and hardware criteria. I conduct daily checks to ensure their continual functionality and efficiency. Additionally, I deploy Grafana for live server monitoring on each server, and I depend on Telegram bots to promptly alert me of any potential issues or anomalies.
